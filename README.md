## Notes

I was unable to using the Rating Bar on my Details Page and attempting to figure this problem out used much of my time. 
The Rating Bar would never show the numStars (5) nor fill in the hard-coded amount of stars when being tested.
I also could not figure out how to set the width of the poster itself to fill out the entire width it was allotted.
I used the same xml for landscape and portrait view which limited the space that the backdrop picture could have in landscape.
